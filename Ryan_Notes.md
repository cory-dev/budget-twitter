    I removed the "Dashboard" button, and made the home button have the same functionality.

    I stylized it a bit differently, and made a "log out" page, and removed the log out option from the homepage. I imagine we will eventually want to make the header button function as the log out button. 

    Sachit's problem with the Comments not stacking properly, I cannot recreate. I added a "Comments" header to the comments to clarify the transtion to that section. 

    The commnet button text has been changed from "tweet" to "Comment"
