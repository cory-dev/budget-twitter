# Objective: 
Build a Page Content Calibration System that lets the moderator(s) of the site to rank tweets/posts according to the perceived political inclination (imagine Left/Centrist/Right leaning) and accuracy of information (numeric score and comments) presented. These scores are aggregated at the end and shown on the post/tweet. (Our website would be a repository of political inclination and accuracy ranking of profiles by their previous posts/tweets from FB/Insta/Twitter)

# Additional Comments:
> We start with a few sample twitter profiles and tweets across a week or so. 
> I open our website and in the search bar we type the username of the twitter profile and it shows up a ranking next to his/her name. 
> We can deep dive into how that profile was assigned a score by looking at how his past tweets were rated/ranked/comments.
