1. KIEI451 Final should be the project name on our Firebase console.
2. I created a firebase database (see Build > Cloud Firestore) in test mode and location nam5.
3. Added the following files: icons (to store our icons n images), twitter.css to store the styling, scoring.html for saying a few lines on scoring, about.html to say a few files on us.

> Firebase.js
1. Added firebase config to firebase.js.

> index.html
1. Used this (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp) to build navigation bar 
2. Added div class="topnav">
3. Added link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="twitter.css" /> for css tied to the topnav

> twitter.css
1. Added a twitter.css file for us to put styling elements in the page
2. TODO: Need to add styling colors from here: https://brandpalettes.com/twitter-colors/

> Scoring, About.html
1. TODO: Need to update these later

> Tips:
